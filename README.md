## Introduction

Transformers have revolutionized various fields in deep learning, including natural language processing and computer vision. These models are known for their parallelizable and scalable nature, making them highly effective for various tasks. This repository explores the implementation of Transformer-based architectures in deep learning, primarily focusing on Vision Transformers (ViT) and Detection Transformers (Detr).

## Implemented Architectures

### Vision Transformer (ViT)

The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a novel architecture that applies the Transformer model to computer vision tasks, such as image classification. In this repository, you can find an implementation of the ViT model.

### Detection Transformer (DETR)

The Detection Transformer (Detr) is a Transformer-based architecture designed for object detection tasks. It combines the power of Transformers with object detection, making it efficient and accurate. This repository includes an implementation of Detr, complete with pre-trained models and utilities for object detection tasks.
